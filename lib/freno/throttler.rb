  # Freno::Throttler is the class responsible for throttling writes to a cluster
  # or a set of clusters. Throttling means to slow down the pace at which write
  # operations occur by checking with freno whether all the clusters affected by
  # the operation are in good health before allowing it. If any of the clusters
  # is not in good health, the throttler will wait some time and repeat the
  # process.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  # Let's use the following throttler, which uses Mapper::Identity implicitly.
  # (see #initialze docs)
  #
  # ```
  # throttler = Throttler.new(client: freno_client, app: :my_app)
  # data.find_in_batches do |batch|
  #   throttler.throttle([:mysqla, :mysqlb]) do
  #     update(batch)
  #   end
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # Before each call to `update(batch)` the throttler will call freno to
  # check the health of the `mysqla` and `mysqlb` stores on behalf of :my_app;
  # and sleep if any of the stores is not ok.
  #

    # Initializes a new instance of the throttler
    #
    # In order to initialize a Throttler you need the following arguments:
    #
    #  - a `client`: a instance of Freno::Client
    #
    #  - an `app`: a symbol indicating the app-name for which Freno will respond
    #    checks.
    #
    # Also, you can optionally provide the following named arguments:
    #
    #  - `:mapper`: An object that responds to `call(context)` and returns a
    #     `Enumerable` of the store names for which we need to wait for
    #     replication delay. By default this is the `IdentityMapper`, which will
    #     check the stores given as context.
    #
    #     For example, if the `throttler` object used the default mapper:
    #
    #      ```
    #      throttler.throttle(:mysqlc) do
    #         update(batch)
    #      end
    #      ```
    #
    #  - `:instrumenter`: An object that responds to
    #     `instrument(event_name, context = {}, &block)` that can be used to
    #     add cross-cutting concerns like logging or stats to the throttler.
    #
    #     By default, the instrumenter is `Instrumenter::Noop`, which does
    #     nothing but yielding the block it receives.
    #
    #  - `:circuit_breaker`: An object responding to `allow_request?`,
    #     `success`, and `failure?`, compatible with `Resilient::CircuitBreaker`
    #     (see https://github.com/jnunemaker/resilient).
    #
    #     By default, the circuit breaker is `CircuitBreaker::Noop`, which
    #     always allows requests, and does not provide resiliency guarantees.
    #
    #  - `:wait_seconds`: A positive float indicating the number of seconds the
    #     throttler will wait before checking again, in case some of the stores
    #     didn't catch-up the last time they were check.
    #
    #  - `:max_wait_seconds`: A positive float indicating the maxium number of
    #     seconds the throttler will wait in total for replicas to catch-up
    #     before raising a `WaitedTooLong` error.

    # This method receives a context to infer the set of stores that it needs to
    # throttle writes to. It can also receive additional options which are
    # passed to the underlying Check request object:
    #
    # ```
    # throttler = Throttler.new(client: freno_client, app: :my_app)
    # data.find_in_batches do |batch|
    #   throttler.throttle(:mysqla, low_priority: true) do

    # end
    # ```
    #
    # With that information it asks freno whether all the stores are ok.
    # In case they are, it executes the given block.
    # Otherwise, it waits `wait_seconds` before trying again.
    #
    # In case the throttler has waited more than `max_wait_seconds`, it raises
    # a `WaitedTooLong` error.
    #
    # In case there's an underlying Freno error, it raises a `ClientError`
    # error.

    # - "throttler.waited" when the stores were not ok, after waiting
    #   `wait_seconds`
    # - "throttler.waited_too_long" when the stores were not ok, but the
    #   thottler already waited at least `max_wait_seconds`, right before
    #   raising `WaitedTooLong`
    # - "throttler.freno_errored" when there was an error with freno, before
    #   raising `ClientError`.
    # - "throttler.circuit_open" when the circuit breaker does not allow the
    #   next request, before raising `CircuitOpen`
